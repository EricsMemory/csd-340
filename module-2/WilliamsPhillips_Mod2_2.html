        <p class="intro">My name is Eric Williams Phillips and I am from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ann Arbor is a pretty decently sized college town that has fun things to do in every little corner. Growing up, my friends and I would walk to the library and read manga. As we got older we started taking walks in nature parks to pass time and play card games!</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I spend most of my time at home in my room. <span class="sentence">At 29 years old, there isn't much freetime outside of work and school.</span> The freetime that I do have, I am either playing video games or studying for a Google UX certification.</p>
        <p>I have 5 other siblings, most of which are already moved out. The ones that remain are much younger than the rest of us, so I help out with taking care of them whenever I need to. Because of this, my freetime is even more limited, but I can't complain. Sometimes I mind it, but most of the time it doesn't bother me too much.</p>
        <p>I no longer have any pets, but have had a variety through my childhood. My first pet was a beautiful but older cat named Fremont. We had a tragic house fire when I was around 6 or 7 and unfortunately he did not make. We then got a Jack Russel Terrier named Lucky that I practically grew up with. From here we bought a few cats that bred a litter of Sphinx kittens! We gave them to our family members and kept one that we named Finkle. Finkle recently passed away due to old age and I have not had any pet since.</p>
